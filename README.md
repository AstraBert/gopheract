# gopheract

A ReAct agent implemented in Go with OpenAI.

Find an example implementation as an ACP-compliant CLI agent in the [`cli` folder](./cli/).

Take a look at the [documentation](https://gopheract.clelia.dev).

> _This is still in development (missing tests and documentation for the CLI package), so be careful if you decide to use it!_
